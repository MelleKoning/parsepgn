##parsepgn

Used to analyse chess PGN files.

The goal here is to get an overview of the number of moves of the game for reaching draw, win, loss for each player.

This is to see if one player wins sooner then the other player.

Code used specifically for lc0 tests to see what PRs could help against trolling in endgames.
